Consider the 6 tape segments and 2 states the checker is looking for. For ease of visualisation I'll give them 1 letter names:
- Base = s
- Head = h
- Buffer1 = b
- Buffer2 = p
- Increment1 = i
- Increment2 = j
- State1 = X (always reading the leftmost symbol of the segment to the right)
- State2 = Y (always reading the rightmost symbol of the segment to the left)

Assuming the following conditions are met:
(i)	sbXh  turns into siYph	using only the tape positons from b, h, and the infinite 0s to the right
(ii)	siYph turns into sYpjh	using only the tape positions from i and p
(iii)	sYpjh turns into sbXjh	using only the tape positions from s and p
(iv)	sbXjh turns into sibXh	using only the tape positions from b and j

Then we can show by induction that s(i^n)Yph turns into s(i^(n+1))bXh for all n. (use (iii) for the base case and (ii), (iv) for the induction step)
Combine that with (i) to get that once sbXh is reached the machine goes to all the s(i^n)bXh configurations, so it never halts.

-----------------

Now we only need to show that the decider only outputs true if it finds segments and states that meet those conditions.
Clearly it only outputs true if it successively went from phase 0 to phase 6 of the checker.
We go from phase 1 to phase 2, to sbXh is reached.
We go from phase 2 to phase 3, so (i) holds.
We go from phase 3 to phase 4, so (ii) holds.
We go from phase 4 to phase 5, so (iii) holds.
We go from phase 5 to phase 6, so (iv) holds.
